Emotion detection in Arabic text is a relatively new field of research that focuses on developing methods for identifying and analyzing emotions expressed in Arabic texts. This field combines techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, and psychology to classify emotions into predefined categories such as anger, sadness, joy, fear, or surprise. In this project, we adopt multiple techniques to pre-process and clean an existing labeled dataset, as well as fine-tune a classifier in order to classify emotion in a given tweet into one of the basic emotion categories.
